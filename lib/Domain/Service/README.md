Domain services are the coordinators, allowing higher level functionality between many different smaller parts.  These would include things like OrderProcessor, ProductFinder, FundsTransferService, and so on.  Since Domain Services are first-class citizens of our domain model, their names and usages should be part of the Ubiquitous Language.  Meanings and responsibilities should make sense to the stakeholders or domain experts.
